Hey ! I'm Codex ( @C0dex73 )
A full time nerd that learned about programming and computer science in 6th grade.
I have developed apps, games and website but my biggest project so far remains my 8bit Minecraft CPU : XENON (it is finished but so powerless that I will only upload his v2 form wich will be pipenable)
