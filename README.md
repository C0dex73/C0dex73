Hey ! I'm Codex ( @C0dex73 )<br/>
A full time nerd that learned about programming and computer science in 6th grade.<br/>
I have developed apps, games and website but my biggest project so far remains my 8bit Minecraft CPU : XENON <i>(it is finished but so powerless that I will only upload his v2 form wich will be pipenable)</i>
